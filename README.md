# Genius - Memory Game

## About

The project is an exercise from Eduzz Fullstack Developer #2 Bootcamp. The exercise demanded a personal touch on the application. So, I improved the graphic interface adding a simple side menu with two buttons controlling start and stop functions, positioned the game on the right side of the screen creating a division between menu and game. The original JavaScript logic was using alerts to show the application behavior, and I transferred it into the buttons.
